!!! warning
	winaccent is a Windows-only module. Trying to import it on other operating systems will raise an `ImportError` exception. See [Using winaccent in cross-platform applications](../getting-started/example-usage.md#using-winaccent-in-cross-platform-applications) for more information and examples for running winaccent only on Windows systems and recommendations for other platforms.

!!! warning 
	Although both Windows Vista and 7 are supported, the support for these Windows versions is limited. For the features that are currently supported on these versions, see [Windows Vista and 7 compatibility](../other-features/windows_vista_and_7_compatibility.md). See [Using winaccent on Windows Vista and 7](../getting-started/example-usage.md#using-winaccent-on-windows-vista-and-7) for more information about checking the support status and using features not supported by these versions only on the supported versions.
